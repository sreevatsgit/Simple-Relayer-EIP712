# Simple Relayer Project

## Author: Sreevatsan Komandur Sridhar

This project demonstrates a Simple Relayer using Hardhat, upgradable contracts by openzeppelin and NextJS. The relayer uses 4 contracts namely: EIPBaseContract.sol, EIPMeta.sol, SafeMath.sol (Solidity version 0.8.0) and Storage.sol that were created using Hardhat and were deployed at the rinkeby test network.


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
